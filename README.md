This is the readme file for the [Portage Bay](http://djmcloud.danieljmckeown.com/portagebay/) theme for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org).

Portage Bay was created by [Dan McKeown](http://danmckeown.info) in Seattle, Washington, (C) 2015.

This theme used the [MaterializeCSS](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize) project as a front-end framework and [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) as a starting back-end.  Like WordPress, it is licensed under the GNU GPL, [version 2](LICENSE) or later.

The design buzzwords "bold" and "intentional" certainly apply to this large-text, brightly-colored, mobile-responsive theme--clearly it's influenced by [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) from Google.

More information can be found in the [style.css file](style.css) file.
